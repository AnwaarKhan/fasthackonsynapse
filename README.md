Getting up and running with Synapse can sometimes be a complex undertaking. Some customers and engineers just need a push in the right direction. They just need an easily understood and intuitive example/template that they can rely on that will show them what the overall life cycle looks like, how the ingestion pipelines should be set up, how the data goes from raw to curated in their Delta Lake. Basically, what they want is a “Synapse Easy Button”. Something that shows them how the pieces fit together. Well with this template you’ll get that. You’ll be able to setup a Synapse enviornment that leverages Delta Lake, that leverages meta driven ingestion pipelines, and shows you how the data moves from bronze to silver, is easy to understand and implement so that you can easily lay down a proper Synapse environment in less time than expected..
